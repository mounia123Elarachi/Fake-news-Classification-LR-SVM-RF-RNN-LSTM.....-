# Fake-news-Classification-LR-SVM-RF-RNN-LSTM.....-
Classifying fake news is an important problem in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Different algorithms can be used for this task, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)

***"In this project, we employed a variety of techniques and models to tackle the problem of fake news classification. Our approach included******

Feature Representation:

**Bag of Words (BoW)*** to represent the text data in a simple and efficient way.
We also applied Term ****Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)*** to capture the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.
Additionally, we harnessed the power of ***pre-trained GloVe word embeddings*** to create word vectors that carry semantic meaning.
